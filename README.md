# Operating System Projects
#### Taein Um
This repository contains the completed projects done in Operating Systems class in Stony Brook University.


## Overview
These projects delve into the various subsystems of the Linux kernel. I was able to learn to design, implement, and modify Linux kernel code and modules. These include hands-on projects that extend kernel subsystems and test, debug, and evaluate systems software in both kernel and user space.




## Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this course, I was able to:
- Identify and describe the functionality, architecture, and implementation characteristics of various Linux kernel subsystems.
- Design, implement, and modify Linux kernel code and modules.
- Test, debug, and evaluate the performance of systems software using appropriate tools.


## Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: `C`
- Operating System: `Linux` (primarily Linux 5.x kernel)
- Tools: `GCC`, `GDB`, `Make`, `Git`
